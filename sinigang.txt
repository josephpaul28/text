=sinigang=
'''Sinigang''' is a [[Filipino sou]] or [[stew]] characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with [[tamarind]] ([[Filipino]]: 
''sampalok''). It is one of the more popular viands in [[Philippine cuisine]], and is related to the [[Malaysian]] dish ''singgang''.

While present nationwide, sinigang is seen to be culturally [[Tagalog]] in origin, thus the versions found in the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] 
may differ in taste (mainly ginger is an additional ingredient). [[Fish sauce]] is a common condiment for the stew.

=Ingredients=
Sinigang is traditionally tamarind-based. Variations of the dish derive their sourness from
ingredients such as [[guava]], [[calamansi]], [[''kamias'']], [[''santol'']] or unripe mango. Seasoning powder
or [[bouillon cubes]] with a tamarind base are commercial alternatives to using natural fruits.
Meat in sinigang (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) is often stewed with [[tamarinds]],
[[tomatoes]], [[garlic]], and [[onions]]. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang
include [[okra]], [[taro corms]] (''gabi''), white [[radish]] (''labanós''), [[water spinach]] (''kangkóng''), [[yardlong]]
[[beans]] (''sitaw'') and [[eggplant]] (''talóng''). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with green [[long
peppers]] in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation 
includes adding locally made [[miso]].

''Sinampalukang manók or sinampalukan (from sampalok)'' is technically not a variation of sinigang, 
as the chicken has to be sautéed in ginger first instead of all the ingredients being placed simultaneously 
into the pot and brought to a boil. ''Sinampalukan'' is also distinguished by its use of shredded tamarind leaves, 
and is usually made together with [[ginger]], onions, tomatoes, eggplant and spinach.
