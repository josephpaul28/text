=Sisig=
'''Sisig''' is a [[Filipino]] dish made from parts of [[pig]] head and liver, usually seasoned with [[''calamansi'']] and [[chili peppers]].

Sisig was first mentioned in a [[Kapampangan]] dictionary in the 17th Century meaning "to snack on something sour" and "salad". It 
usually refers to [[fruits]], often unripe or half-ripe, sometimes dipped in [[salt]] and [[vinegar]]. It also refers to a method of preparing fish and 
meat, especially [[pork]], which is [[marinated]] in a sour liquid such as [[lemon]] juice or vinegar, then seasoned with salt, pepper and other spices.

== Origin ==
The origins of the word dates back to 1732, and was recorded by [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] friar Diego Bergaño in his ''Vocabulary of the 
Kapampangan Language in Spanish and Dictionary of the Spanish Language in Kapampangan''. Bergaño defines sisig as a "salad,
including green [[papaya]], or green [[guava]] eaten with a dressing of salt, pepper, garlic and vinegar." There is no mention of how long this 
cooking style has existed prior to the coming of the Spaniards during the Age of Conquest. The introduction of meat into the dish does 
not have an exact date as well.

Locals believe that the addition of a pig's head and innards in the dish came from "recycling" the excess meat from the commissaries 
of [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Angeles City]], [[Pampanga]]. Pig heads were  purchased cheap since they were not used in preparing meals for the 
[[United States of America|U.S.]] [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] personnel stationed there during the [[American occupation of the Philippines|American Occupation]] of Luzon and Visayas.

Sisig still has many variations with recipes varying from city to city, and sometimes, family to family, in the Kapampangan province.

=== Sisig queen ===
Lucia Cunanan of Angeles City, also known as "Aling Lucing," has been credited with reinventing sisig by using a sizzling plate to make the 
dish crispier. The [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Tourism]] has acknowledged that her "Aling Lucing's" restaurant had established Angeles City
as the "Sisig Capital of the Philippines" in 1974. Cunanan's trademark sisig was developed in mid-1974 when she served a  concoction of 
boiled and chopped pig ears and cheeks seasoned with vinegar, ''calamansi'' juice, chopped onions and chicken liver and served in hot 
plates. Today, varieties include ''sisig ala pizzailo'', pork combination, green mussels or ''tahong'', mixed seafood, ostrich ''sisig'', 
crocodile sisig, spicy python, frog ''sisig'' and ''[[Tokwa at baboy|tokwa't baboy]]'', among others.

== Preparation ==
According to Cunanan's recipe, preparing ''sisig'' comes in three phases: boiling, broiling and finally grilling. A pig's head is first boiled to 
remove hairs and to tenderize it. Portions of it are then chopped and grilled or broiled. Finally, coarsely chopped onions are added and 
served on a sizzling plate. Variations of ''sisig'' may add any of the following: eggs, ox brains, ''chicharon'' ([[pork rind#Philippines|pork cracklings]]), pork or chicken liver, and [[mayonnaise]]. Recently, local 
chefs have experimented with ingredients other than pork such as [[chicken]], [[squid]], [[tuna]], and [[tofu]].
